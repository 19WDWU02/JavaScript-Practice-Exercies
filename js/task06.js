// Create an script that asks you to list 10 celebrities with 1 prompt per name. You only need to add names to the list, you don't need to edit or remove them. HTML is required for this one and a ul element with the id of `celebrityNames` has been provided for you. The prompt should keep asking for names until 10 names have been entered without you having to press the button multiple times
